These toolchains were built using crosstool-ng commit #358945ff2219e37d280532522d2c62309614d162 in a Debian 11 container.

Both the crosstool-ng config files and sources used to build them are included in the repo.

The toolchains are fully statically linked, and should therefore work on any x86_64 Linux box with a reasonably recent kernel.
